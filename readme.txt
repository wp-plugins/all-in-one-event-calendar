An event calendar system with month and agenda views, upcoming events widget, color-coded categories, recurrence, and import/export of .ics feeds.

== Description ==

Welcome to the All-in-One Event Calendar Plugin, a new way to list your events in WordPress and easily share them with the rest of the world.

Our new calendar system combines a clean visual design, solid architectural patterns and rigorous testing with a powerful set of features to create the most advanced calendar system available for WordPress and one of the most powerful website calendar systems in the world. Best of all: it’s completely free.

= Calendar Features For Users =

This plugin has many features we hope will prove useful to users, including:

* Recurring* events
* Filtering by event category or tag
* Easy sharing with Google Calendar, Apple iCal, MS Outlook and any other system that accepts iCalendar (.ics) feeds
* Embedded Google Maps
* Color-coded events based on category
* Event-registration ready
* Month and agenda views
* Upcoming Events widget
* Links to filtered calendar views

(* Limited recurrence patterns available in first release. Full support to come in the next release.)

= Features for Website and Blog Owners =

* Import other calendars automatically to display in your calendar
* Categorize and tag imported calendar feeds automatically
* Events from [The Events Calendar](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/the-events-calendar/) plugin can also be easily imported

Importing and exporting iCalendar (.ics) feeds is one of the strongest features of the All-in-One Event Calendar system. Enter an event on one site and you can have it appear automatically in another website's calendar. You can even send events from a specific category or tag (or combination of categories and tags).

Why is this cool? It allows event creators to create one event and have it displayed on a few or thousands of calendars with no extra work. And it also allows calendar owners to populate their calendar from other calendar feeds without having to go through the hassle of creating new events. For example, a soccer league can send its game schedule to a community sports calendar, which, in turn, can send only featured games (from all the sports leagues it aggragates) to a community calendar, which features sports as just one category.

= Additional Features =

The All-in-One Event Calendar Plugin also has a few features that will prove useful for website and blog owners:

* Each event is SEO-optimized
* Each event links to the original calendar
* Your calendar can be embedded into a WordPress page without needing to create template files or modify the theme
